# History #
Every time I move away from my computer, due to privacy concerns
I had to log out of whatsapp from my computer, and then had to login again when i want to reuse it.
This was really annoying,
<br>
so i decided to make this little app
<br>

# Introduction #
<b>Locked Whatsapp</b>, is simply a wrapper around https://web.whatsapp.com,
but supports password protection.
To access your web whatsapp account you will have to set a password.

 ##### Usage #####
When you open the app for the first time, it will ask you to create a password to lock the app. 
Thereafter, the app will only be opened using the password you've created.

<br>
Should you forget your password, you can click on Reset, which will automatically log you out from
whatsapp, and ask you to createa new password.

# Download #
I have already received good response from the community.
The binary download links are available here

* Clone the repo (or create a fork and clone the forked repo)
```
git clone https://github.com/daudmalik06/Locked-WhatsApp.git
```
* Install NPM dependencies:
```
npm install
```
* Start the app
```
npm start
```

# Contribution #
Thanks for thinking about contributing.

In fact because of people like you, open source community is alive. 

I am using [electron](https://electron.atom.io/) js to make this wrapper and until now i have made 
binaries only for windows as you know we can make 
cross platform apps with electron.
If you want to contribute, you can make binaries of other platforms or
any other bug fix or improvement will be highly appreciated.
