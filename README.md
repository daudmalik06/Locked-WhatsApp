# History #
Every time I left my computer, due to privacy concerns
I had to log out of Whatsapp from my computer and login again when I needed to reuse it,
I found this is really annoying.
<br>
I decided to make this little app
<br>

# Introduction #
<b>Locked Whatsapp</b> is simply a wrapper around https://web.whatsapp.com
but supports a password protection.
To access your web Whatsapp account you will have to setup a password.

 ##### Usage #####
When you open this app for first time it will ask you for a
password to unlock the app and after that it will be unlocked only
using that password.

<br>
If you forget your password, you can click on reset and this will automatically log you out of whatsapp
and will ask you for a new password.

# Download #
I already have received good responses from the community,
the binary download links are available here
https://sourceforge.net/projects/locked-whatsapp/

# Local Setup #
* Clone the repo (or create a fork and clone the forked repo)
```
git clone https://github.com/daudmalik06/Locked-WhatsApp.git
```
* Install NPM dependencies:
```
npm install
```
* Start the app
```
npm start
```

# Contribution #
Thank you for thinking about contributing.

The open source community is live because of people like you . 

I used [electron](https://electron.atom.io/) js to make this wrapper and so far I have made 
binaries only for windows, however electron is capable of making cross platform apps, so if you want to contribute you can make binaries of other platforms or
any other bug fix or improvement will be highly appreciated.
