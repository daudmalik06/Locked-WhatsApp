# History #
Every time I get away from my computer, I was automatically logged out of WhatsApp from the computer and login again when I reuse it.
This was very annoying.
<br>
So I decided to make this little app.
<br>

# Introduction #
<b>Locked Whatsapp</b> is simply a wrapper around https://web.whatsapp.com
but it supports password protection.
A password is required to access your web whatsApp account. 

 ##### Usage #####
The first time you open the app, it will ask you for a  
password to lock the app and after that it will be unlocked only
using that password.

<br>
Incase you forget your password, you can reset 
it and you will be automatically logged of whatsapp
and a password will be required for your next login.

# Download #
I have received good response from community,
the binary download links are available here
https://sourceforge.net/projects/locked-whatsapp/

# Local Setup #
* Clone the repo (or create a fork and clone the forked repo)
```
git clone https://github.com/daudmalik06/Locked-WhatsApp.git
```
* Install NPM dependencies:
```
npm install
```
* Start the app
```
npm start
```

# Contribution #
Thanks for your contribution.

Its because of people like you that the open source community is live. 

I am using [electron](https://electron.atom.io/) js to make this wrapper and up until now I have made 
binaries only for windows, but we can also do cross platform apps with electron.
So if you want to contribute you can make binaries of other platforms or
any other bug fix or improvement will be highly appreciated.
